# Full Stack Shipping Analytics App
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of full-stack development, showcasing the seamless integration of a PostgreSQL back-end database, HTML and JavaScript front-end, and Python Flask framework. By leveraging these technologies, we have successfully created a robust web application hosted on Heroku.

The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a platform to execute diverse queries and gain insights from the "shipment" dataset. Built upon the star schema, this dataset forms the foundation of our application.

Through our meticulously designed functions, users can effortlessly explore the data from multiple perspectives. These functions include viewing raw shipping data, analyzing shipping products by destinations with interactive visualizations, and examining shipping region and time periods by ship.

To enhance user experience, our web application features a user-friendly interface equipped with search functionality and chart visualizations. These elements not only facilitate comprehension but also streamline the data analysis process.
